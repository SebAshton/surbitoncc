### Social
In between midweek hill reps or pain cave sessions, we all love getting out on the bike - we’re only a short ride away from the Surrey Hills, Windsor, Richmond Park or even Brighton. While we all want to improve and get the best out of ourselves, you can still expect an unhealthy mix of coffee, cinnabuns and energy drinks, and the occasional beer or other socials.

SCC is your club and together we will run an inclusive annual trip open to all. The location is decided by the members and could vary from a Spring Classic cobble and waffle fest, to a summer trip in the Alps. Whilst the club will commit to one, members should feel empowered to take the lead and instigate other adventures.

We think Surbiton rocks, yes we’re biased, come hang with us at one of the local taprooms.

### Racing
Some people just need to scratch that competitive itch and enjoy some racing together. Whether crits at one of London’s numerous circuits or out in the lanes racing the Surrey League, we’ll be getting involved, and we actively encourage you to join us. It’s a team sport and the goal is to make our racers feel part of a unit that looks out for each other, rather than showing up to a winter crit and hoping to spot someone you recognise in the pack.

For now, our intentions are to build on this when racing restarts, with the target being to have a team ready to enter some stage races in 2021.

Rumour has it, some members of the team like to hoard bikes, we're confident you'll also find some CX and track action - we’re not far from Herne Hill Velodrome.

### Etiquette
As with all cycling clubs, we do of course expect members to be well versed in the etiquette of group riding; using hand signals as appropriate and being aware that whilst riding in SCC club kit,  you must be on absolute best behaviour. If you’re joining a ride that’s been advertised as a chain gang, be sure to know what a chain gang is, or if you don’t - don’t be scared to ask, other members are here to help and introduce each other to new disciplines and techniques.
