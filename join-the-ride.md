We understand that trying out something new can be daunting. If you think the club is for you, come along and meet the team. Pushing pedals with us is de rigueur before applying, and we welcome anyone to join for up-to 3 rides.

We encourage all prospective members to register [on the forum](https://forum.surbiton.cc/) and [introduce themselves](https://forum.surbiton.cc/d/11-introduce-yourself).

Once you've registered you'll be able to see the rides that get posted up.
